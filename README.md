# My Pong Game 🎮

## Tools: 
- C++ 💻
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) 🎨

## Overview:
My Pong game is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Pong game, created using C++ and SFML. This game allows a player to play against a computer in a fun and interactive way, all while providing several additional features like background music, pause functionality, restart option, and the ability to mute the music. The game is developed to run directly in the console.

### Key Features:
- **Player vs. Machine** gameplay 🤖
- **Background Music** that enhances the gaming experience 🎶
- **Pause & Restart** functionalities ⏸️🔄
- **Mute Option** for the background music 🔊❌
- Simple, intuitive controls and game mechanics 🎮

## Skills and Concepts:
The game was developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in C++:
- **Inheritance**: Used to create classes for different game elements, such as paddles and ball, by inheriting common properties.
- **Method Overriding**: Customized behavior for certain classes to adjust gameplay logic (e.g., updating positions of paddles or the ball).
- **Singleton Pattern**: Applied to manage the game state and ensure only one instance of the game logic exists at any given time.

SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) was used for creating the game’s **interface** (rendering the paddles, ball, and background) and for handling **audio** (playing background music and managing sound effects).

## How to Play:
- **Player**: Use the up and down arrow keys to move your paddle ⬆️⬇️.
- **Objective**: Keep the ball from passing your paddle and score points by sending the ball past your opponent's paddle ⚽🏓.
- **Pause**: Press the 'P' key to pause the game ⏸️.
- **Restart**: Press the 'R' key to restart the game 🔄.
- **Mute**: Press the 'M' key to mute or unmute the background music 🔇.
